# bulkai

**bulkai** is a tool to generate AI images in bulk

## Features

**bulkai** works with the following AI image generators:

 - Midjourney
 - Bluewillow

**bulkai** automates the following tasks:

 - Send prompts to the AI
 - Upscale the generated images
 - Or crop the preview images if upscale is disabled
 - Optionally, generate variations of the generated images
 - Download the generated images
 - Create thumbnails
 - Generate a HTML album page with the generated images

## Installation

You can use the golang binary to install **bulkai**:

```bash
go install github.com/igolaizola/bulkai/cmd/bulkai@latest
```

Or you can download the binary from the [releases](https://github.com/igolaizola/bulkai/releases)

## Usage 

### 1. Create session (only for the first time)

You first need to create a session file with the discord credentials and other information retrieved from your browser.
**bulkai** needs this to:

 - Be able to login to Discord
 - Mimic the browser and avoid being detected as a bot

Use the `bulkai create-session` command to create the session file.
It will open a chrome window and you will need to login to Discord.

```bash
bulkai create-session
```

### 2. Configure settings

You can configure different settings.
See the parameters section to see all available options: [Parameters](#parameters)

Using a configuration file in YAML format:

```bash
bulkai generate --config bulkai.yaml
```

bulkai.yaml
```yaml
bot: midjourney
album: cute-animals
download: true
upscale: true
variation: false
thumbnail: true
suffix: " --ar 3:2"
prompt:
  - cute-animals-1.txt
  - cute-animals-2.txt
  - cute monkey dancing on a tree
```

### 2. Launch

Use the `bulkai generate` command to launch the generation.
Images will be downloaded to the album name in the output directory specified in the configuration file.
You will be able to see the progress in the console.
This task can take a long time depending on the number of images to generate.

```bash
bulkai generate
```

You can press `Ctrl+C` to stop the generation.
If you want to resume the generation, just press launch the command again using the same settings and album name.
Prompt field will be ignored and the prompts will be loaded from the album.

## Parameters

Here is a list of all the parameters available to run the image generation.

 - `bot` (string): Name of the bot to use.
Available options are: `midjourney` and `bluewillow`. (required)
 - `download` (bool): Download the generated images. (default: `true`)
 - `upscale` (bool): Upscale the generated images. (default: `true`)

This will generate 4 extra variations of each prompt.

If unset the maximum for the bot will be used.

## FAQ

### Do I need to generate a new session every time I want to use use **bulkai**?

No, you only need to generate a new session if you want to use a different account.

### Do I need to enable relaxed mode?

It is up to you to use relaxed or fast mode.
Just keep in mind that if you use fast mode with a lot of prompts, you may consume your quota very quickly.

## I'm getting `couldn't find dm channel for bot` error

You must manually join the discord server of the bot you want to use.
Then you have to open a DM chat with the bot.
Alternatively, you can specify the channel to use in the form `guild/channel`.
The bot must be available in the channel you specify.
